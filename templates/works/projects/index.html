        A company I co-founded together with two of my friends as a part of my
        high school education. We sell all kinds of candles, and we make them
        all by hand. I made this website to upgrade our web prescence and enable
        customers to purchase our products from the comfort of their own homes.
        Check it out and consider buying a candle or two!

        This is Märit Olofsson Nääs' personal blogpage where she primarily
        writes about her horse riding. It contains almost 1000 blog posts and
        even more images, from 2010 to today. I converted it from Silverstripe
        CMS to Wordpress for her. I kept the design very close to the previous
        site's but made various improvements and made the site mobile friendly.

        SAS Virtual Group is a virtual airline, which means they use flight
        simulation software to as accurately as possible simulate real world
        airlines. SAS Virtual Group in particular only flies the same routes and
        aircrafts as the real-life airline SAS. This website helps them submit
        reports of their flights, track how much they fly, view the available
        routes, view announcements from the virutal airline's staff, and more,
        all in one place.

    <p>
        Runyonii is a web app where you can chat with a friend or groups of
        them. It features offline persistence, which means it caches it's
        contents so that it can be accessed without the internet. It can send
        notifications when you recieve messages. Runyonii will soon be
        deprecated and replaced by Echeveria, which does not use firebase,
        unlike Runyonii.

        This a simple program that allows you to view the weather at many
        different airports around Sweden. It pulls METAR data from the internet
        and converts it to a human readable format with icons for easier
        scanning. You can view the weather directly in your browser or you can
        download applications for Linux/X11, Windows, and Android.
