        A company I co-founded together with two of my friends as a part of my
        high school education. We sell all kinds of candles, and we make them
        all by hand. I made this website to upgrade our web prescence and enable
        customers to purchase our products from the comfort of their own homes.
        Check it out and consider buying a candle or two!

        This is Märit Olofsson Nääs' personal blogpage where she primarily
        writes about her horse riding. It contains almost 1000 blog posts and
        even more images, from 2010 to today. I converted it from Silverstripe
        CMS to Wordpress for her. I kept the design very close to the previous
        site's but made various improvements and made the site mobile friendly.

        This a simple program that allows you to view the weather at many
        different airports around Sweden. It pulls METAR data from the internet
        and converts it to a human readable format with icons for easier
        viewing. You can view the weather directly in your browser or you can
