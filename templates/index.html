<p>
	I am a web developer and have been since 2017. Other than web development, I
	make all kinds of designs. You can find some of them on the <a
		href="/works/design/">Design</a> page. My other hobbies include
	photography, programming, Linux, biking, judo, languages, and piano. I put
	my photographs on the <a href="/works/gallery/">Gallery</a> page, but the
	other hobbies haven't quite made it onto this site yet. Maybe I'll write
	more about some of those here, some day in the future.

<h3>This site</h3>

	I usually use lots of JavaScript but I chose to make this website completely
	without it. You can find the source on
	<a href="https://github.com/ebinbellini/ebinbellini">GitHub</a>.
	The fonts used are
	<a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/im-fell-english-font.html">IM FELL
		English</a>, which was digitally reproduced by
	<a href="https://iginomarini.com">Igino Marini</a>, and
	<a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/typographerwoodcutinitialsone-font.html">
		Typographer Woodcut Initials One</a>, which was made by
