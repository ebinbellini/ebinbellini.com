	I made an advertisement sign for a car's license plate frame just for fun.
	I designed it in Autodesk Inventor and 3D-printed it. I'm quite happy with
	how it looks. Here it is:
</p>

<div class="pic-caption">
	Here's how it looks. The text says &#x201c;Happy monday!" in Swedish.
</div>

<p>
	It is attached to the car using the standard method, which I don't know the
	name of but I'm going to call them &#x201c;clips". I couldn't find any blueprint or
	any dimensions of these but I did find an image of a license plate frame and
	scaled the image to around real size so that I could see at least how high
	and wide the clips should be. I also used that image for determining where
	to place the clips.
</p>

<p>
	It later turned out that I didn't scale the image correctly and the clips
	therefore ended up slightly too far away from each other. To fix the problem I
	simply cut off parts of the clips so that they would fit in the holes. Some
	of them broke when I did that but the problem was fixed easily with super
	glue.

	The sign was too big to fit in the 3D-printer so I had to divide it into
	three parts. I assembled them by drilling two small holes on each side and
	then inserting glue and a short piece of steel wire. It became quite sturdy
	this way.

	This is how I put the parts together.

	I then painted the sign. First I painted the letters and flowers white to
	hide the plastic texture. Then I painted the rest with a nice metallic green
	color that we happened to have at home.

	And then it was done. It's not perfect because of the sloppy paint job and
	the visible cracks in between the pieces but I think it's still pretty good.
