	What up, what up?? After half a year of not using this blog I am finally
	back, this time in English. The reason I haven't posted anything is that I
	kind of just didn't feel like it. So what happened today? I played some
	frisbee golf with my friends and got my first hole in one! That was quite
	epic. I also worked a bit on a client's website.

<p>
	I bought a DJI Mavic Air drone a few weeks ago and I crashed it yesterday.
	It was quite rough and 3 of the 4 propellers broke. I have ordered new ones.
	I might make a video with my drone footage either on YouTube or Instagram
	sometime but I'm kind of busy right now.

<p>
	As you might be able to see, I now have a new logo, which is the one with
	flowers and a globe with electronic devices hovering around it. I am quite
	proud of it. To match this logo, I have also changed the font to
	<a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/im-fell-english-font.html">IM FELL
		English </a> which is currently my favorite. It is based on a font used
	by Oxford University Press a long time ago that was imported to England by
	Dr. John Fell sometime in the late 17th century. The &ldquo;IM" stands for
	<a href="https://iginomarini.com/">Igino Marini</a>, the person who
	digitally reproduced the fonts.
</p>
<p>
	I also changed the license for this site from BSD 3-Clause to GPLv3 because
	it is cooler. The license isn't very important since this is just for my
	personal website but if someone finds something they think is neat, such as
	a css animation or an icon, and wants to copy it to their website, they
	won't be confused and won't have to ask for permission.
