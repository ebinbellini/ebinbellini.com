<p>
	Today I got home from Öland, Sweden's second biggest island. We were there
	for two weeks, and walked through the unique &ldquo;alvar&rdquo; landscapes,
	which is a biotope consisting of limestone ground covered by a thin layer of
	dirt with sparse vegetation. The alvar grounds have, in most places, next to
	no ability to hold water, and are therefore very dry, so it's pretty much as
	close to a desert as you can get in Sweden.

	We went to different beaches around the Island. The weather was almost
	perfect. It was warm enough so that it's comfortable to be in the water, and
	cool enough to not get sweaty, tired, and sunburnt when on the surface.

<p>
	There are many flee markets all around the Island, much more than in any
	other place that I know of. I'm usually not very enthusiastic about them,
	but this year I bought a lamp, a coffee mug, two ceramic bowls, one tin
	chalice, and six books.

	Before we went to Öland, we hiked for a week in the Lunndörrsfjällen area.
	We carried heavy bags, filled with our tent, food, clothes, and equipment.
	My bag weighed about 20 kg. We walked 12-22 km per day, some days
	on a trail, some days in places that are far more trafficked by reindeers
	than by humans. We walked from Kläppen, where we parked, then up past
	Vålåstugorna, down into Storådalen, up through Lundörren, and then back to
	the car.

	It was a very tough trip, but it was fun and it felt good to leave everyday
	life for a while, but it was also nice afterwards to come back home to
	the luxury that is having electricity, heat, and running water.
