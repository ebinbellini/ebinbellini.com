	Today I created an RSS feed for these blog posts. It was pretty easy to do,
	even though I had to implement the logic for it myself. The RSS protocol has
	really earned it's name: <i>Really Simple Syndication</i> because it really
	is simple. All it took was using Golang's text/template package to make a
	dynamic XML file and then fill it with info about my posts.

		This page
	</a> documents the RSS syntax and was very useful to me during this process.
