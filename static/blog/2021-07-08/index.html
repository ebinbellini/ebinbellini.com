	Today me and my family got home from our hike to and from Vålådalsstugorna
	in northern Sweden. From where we parked the car it was slightly less than
	20 kilometers to the station. We began the hike yesterday and it started to
	rain early on but it cleared up quickly and we had great weather for
	the better part of the trip.

	On the way up we met a woman with a huge reindeer antler sticking out of her
	backpack. She told us that she had found it while walking and had been
	carrying it since one day ago. After that I started looking around for
	antlers while walking but I never found any. That may be because it's a
	somewhat popular trail and that any antlers have therefore already been
	found.

	On the way back, we saw a lagopus. We came pretty close to it before it
	started fleeing and that's when we noticed it. It didn't run very far even
	then so I was able to bring out my binoculars and take a picture through
	them.
